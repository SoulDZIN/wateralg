# Water Algorithm

This is an implementation of the water fill problem.

### Example:

Given a grid, with columns along X, how many cells of "water" can be filled, considering runoff: 

*Example Grid*

```
          _
         | |
 _       | |         _
  |      | |        | |
  | _  _ | | _    _ | |   _
  |  |  |  |  |  | |  |  | |
 _| _| _| _| _| _|_| _| _|_| _
```

*Result: 14*

Note: the bottom is solid, but the left edge and right edge are open (there are no walls).
